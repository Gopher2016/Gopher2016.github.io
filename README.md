# Jacob's Data Science Blog

Please visit https://gopher2016.github.io/ for an updated blog where I post interesting data science projects I have recently worked on.  Previous projects have included analyses on New York City metro transit data, country-level regression analysis of GDP per capita, classification of malignant tumors from breast mass tissue data, topic modeling of cryptocurrency tweets, and time-series analysis of retail sales data.
